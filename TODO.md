# To Do

* [x] Get the REPL working again
* [x] Get some nice circular sliders (like http://www.toolitup.com/circular-slider.html)
* [x] Smooth animations from one IFS to another -- hopefully get rid of the "draw" button
* [x] Integrate with fancy WebGL or canvas library for better faster rendering
* [ ] Update URL with de jong paramters for sharing
* [ ] Integrate web workers to move point calculations to another thread
  * [ ] Use multiple workers to calculate many more points simultaneously
